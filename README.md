## ⚙️ Configuration

The model supports flexible configuration through `src/config/settings.py`:

```python
@dataclass
class ModelConfig:
    vocab_size: int = 65          # Vocabulary size
    n_embd: int = 64             # Embedding dimension
    n_head: int = 4              # Number of attention heads
    n_layer: int = 4             # Number of transformer layers
    block_size: int = 32         # Maximum sequence length
    dropout: float = 0.1         # Dropout probability

@dataclass
class TrainingConfig:
    batch_size: int = 16         # Training batch size
    learning_rate: float = 1e-3  # Peak learning rate
    max_iters: int = 5000        # Maximum training steps
    warmup_iters: int = 100      # Learning rate warmup steps
    grad_clip: float = 1.0       # Gradient clipping threshold
    weight_decay: float = 1e-1   # Weight decay coefficient
```
